# Rentable Coding Exercise

This app was created with a back-end framework of Node.js. The front end was built with React.js. Axios was used as the HTTP client. xml2js was used to parse xml.

### Getting Started

Set-up should be fairly easy for this application. Clone the repo down locally and open in your editor of choice. From the project directory, on the command line run `npm install`. This should set up the dependencies for the project.

To boot up the project in your browser, run `npm run build` to bundle with webpack. Run `npm start` to run the start script and load the project in your browser. If successful, in the console you should see

```
[nodemon] starting `node server/index.js`
App running on localhost:3000
```

Open a browser tab to `localhost:3000` and the project should be running.
